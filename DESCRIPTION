Description: Enables researchers to statistically simulate congressional redistricting plans using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. This includes the implementation of substantive constraints in the redistricting process such as geographic compactness and population parity requirements, as well as efficient simulation methods such as simulated tempering algorithms. Tools for analysis such as inverse probability reweighting and plotting functionality are included. The package implements methods described in Fifield, Higgins, Imai and Tarr (2015) "A New Automated Redistricting Simulator Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo," working paper available at <http://http://imai.princeton.edu/research/files/redist.pdf>.
